Software Engineering Project

Description: For my Software Engineering class we had to develop a standalone Java
			 application. We decided to make a application that allows the customer users 
			 to shop for projects by viewing, adding or removing the products. Also 
			 implemented logins for the Employees and Administrative side so they can
			 adjust pricess and amount of products if need be and do other tasks.
			 
Additional:  Also created Use Cases, Sequence Diagrams and Tested.
